## Code Quality Findings

### HIGH PRIORITY

*No outstanding high priority issues*

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

*No outstanding medium priority issues*

### LOW PRIORITY

#### CR-L1: TypeScript Token Validation Enhancement
**File:** `server/src/typescript/common-utils.ts`  
**Description:** Authentication token validation could be more robust.

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
function validateToken(token: string): boolean {
    if (!token || token.trim().length === 0) return false;
    
    // Basic format validation for common token formats
    return /^[A-Za-z0-9+/=_-]+$/.test(token.trim());
}

export function saveAuthTokenToStorage(token: string): boolean {
    if (!validateToken(token)) return false;
    // ... rest of implementation
}
```

**Impact:** Low - adds input validation for better error handling.

*No outstanding low priority issues*

## Architecture & Design Patterns ðŸ“Š **Grade: A+**

**Strengths:**
- **Simplified client architecture**: `CryptoClient<Payload>` â†’ `WebClient<Vec<u8>>` provides clean abstraction
- **Trait-based extensibility**: `Client<T>` trait enables type-safe payload handling
- **Dependency injection**: Factory pattern for CLI with `Factory` trait providing both clients and observers
- **Zero-knowledge implementation**: All encryption/decryption happens client-side
- **Build-time generation**: Template processing at compile time reduces runtime overhead
- **SessionStorage authentication**: Secure token management with automatic cleanup
- **Utility module architecture**: Extensible `utils/` structure for cross-cutting concerns
- **Content analysis**: Binary detection prevents data corruption automatically
- **Enhanced memory safety**: Comprehensive `CryptoContext` encapsulation with automatic cleanup

**Code Examples:**
```rust
// Simplified client architecture with enhanced security
pub fn new() -> impl Client<Payload> {
    CryptoClient::new(Box::new(WebClient::new()))
}

// CryptoContext with comprehensive memory safety
struct CryptoContext {
    key: Vec<u8>,
    nonce: Vec<u8>,
}

impl Drop for CryptoContext {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        self.zeroize();
    }
}

// Build-time template generation
fn generate_static_html_files() {
    let mut tt = TinyTemplate::new();
    let context = create_version_context();
    generate_html_file(&tt, "create-secret", &context, "src/includes/create-secret.html");
}
```

## Recent Improvements (Version 1.8.1)

### Cryptographic Architecture Refactoring
- **Simplified client layer**: Removed `SecretClient` layer, integrated serialization into `CryptoClient`
- **Enhanced memory safety**: Comprehensive `CryptoContext` with automatic cleanup via `Drop` trait
- **Type safety**: `CryptoClient<Payload>` ensures only encrypted data crosses network boundaries
- **Complete zeroization**: All sensitive data wrapped in `Zeroizing<T>` containers
- **Encapsulated operations**: All AES-GCM operations contained within `CryptoContext`

### Memory Safety Enhancements
- **Automatic cleanup**: `Drop` implementations for `CryptoContext` and `Payload` structs
- **Secure data flow**: All plaintext data immediately wrapped in `Zeroizing<T>`

- **Serialization safety**: Payload serialization wrapped in `Zeroizing<Vec<u8>>`
- **Decryption safety**: Decrypted data wrapped in `Zeroizing<Vec<u8>>`

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Reduced complexity**: Simplified architecture with fewer layers
- **Clear boundaries**: Distinct security boundaries between encrypted and plaintext data
- **Enhanced testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for new serialization functionality
- **Better encapsulation**: Cryptographic operations fully contained within `CryptoContext`

    // Complete roundtrip testing with mock implementations
}

// TypeScript comprehensive testing
describe('SessionStorage Auth Token Management', () => {
    test('should save token to sessionStorage', () => {
        const result = saveAuthTokenToStorage("test-token-123");
        expect(result).toBe(true);
        const stored = sessionStorage.getItem("hakanai-auth-token");
