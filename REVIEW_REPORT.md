- **HTTP Handling**: Comprehensive security headers and CORS configuration
- **Observability**: Full OpenTelemetry integration (traces, metrics, logs)
- **Storage**: Clean trait-based abstraction with Redis implementation
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper status codes and error handling

**Security Implementations:**
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` for clickjacking protection
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` for MIME sniffing protection

- Configurable upload size limits and input validation

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Test Statistics ‚úÖ
- **Total Tests**: 34 tests across all crates
- **Pass Rate**: 100% (all tests passing)
- **Coverage Areas**:
  - Unit tests: Crypto operations, HTTP client, CLI parsing
  - Integration tests: API endpoints, error handling
  - End-to-end tests: Complete crypto workflows

### Test Quality Assessment
- **CLI Tests (13)**: Comprehensive argument parsing and validation scenarios
- **Library Tests (12)**: Crypto operations, HTTP client behavior, error conditions
- **Server Tests (9)**: API functionality, authentication, error handling
- **Edge Cases**: Invalid inputs, network failures, authentication errors

## Security Assessment

Based on the existing comprehensive security audit report, the security posture is **excellent**:

- ‚úÖ **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Client-side encryption prevents server access to plaintext
- ‚úÖ **Cryptographic Security**: AES-256-GCM with proper nonce handling
- ‚úÖ **Timing Attack Protection**: Constant-time token comparison using `subtle` crate
- ‚úÖ **Input Validation**: UUID validation, TTL limits, payload size restrictions
- ‚úÖ **Security Headers**: Comprehensive HTTP security header implementation
- ‚úÖ **No Critical Vulnerabilities**: No security issues identified in audit

## Architecture and Design Patterns
