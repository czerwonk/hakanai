# Code Review Report: Hakanai

## Executive Summary

Hakanai is a well-architected zero-knowledge secret sharing service built with Rust. The codebase demonstrates solid engineering practices with clean separation of concerns, comprehensive testing, and proper security implementations. The project consists of three well-defined crates (lib, cli, server) with ~1.5k lines of code and extensive test coverage.

**Overall Grade: A-**

## Architecture Overview

### Strengths
- **Clean Layered Architecture**: Well-separated concerns with lib/cli/server structure
- **Generic Client Design**: Flexible `Client<T>` trait with type-safe payload handling
- **Zero-Knowledge Implementation**: Proper client-side encryption with AES-256-GCM
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 6 files with unit tests, mock implementations, and integration tests
- **Modern Rust Practices**: Uses Rust 2024 edition with appropriate dependency management

## Code Quality Assessment

### Excellent Practices

1. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types using `thiserror` with proper error propagation
2. **Security**: 
   - AES-256-GCM encryption with proper nonce handling
   - Constant-time token comparison using `subtle` crate
   - Secure random key generation with `OsRng`
3. **Testing**: Extensive test coverage with mocks and edge case handling
4. **Documentation**: Well-documented public APIs with proper rustdoc comments
5. **Memory Safety**: Proper use of Rust's ownership system and async/await patterns

### Areas for Improvement

#### High Priority Issues

1. **Key Management Security** (`lib/src/crypto.rs:77-78`)
   - URL-safe base64 encoding for keys reduces entropy from 256 bits to ~254 bits
   - Consider using full 32-byte keys with proper URL encoding instead

2. **Error Information Leakage** (`server/src/web_api.rs:51-52`)
   - Internal errors logged but generic message returned to client
   - Consider adding error correlation IDs for debugging

3. **Resource Limits** (`server/src/main.rs:68-70`)
   - Upload size limit configurable but no rate limiting
   - Missing request size validation at application level

#### Medium Priority Issues

4. **Dependency Versions**
   - Several dependencies could be updated to latest versions
   - Consider pinning major versions for stability

5. **Error Context** (`lib/src/web.rs:49-56`)
   - HTTP error messages include response body which might leak sensitive information
   - Consider sanitizing error messages

6. **Timing Attacks** (`lib/src/crypto.rs:86-115`)
   - Decryption function could be vulnerable to timing attacks
   - Consider adding constant-time operations for payload validation

#### Low Priority Issues

7. **Code Organization**
   - Some functions in `crypto.rs` could be made private
   - Consider extracting common test utilities to reduce duplication

8. **Documentation**
   - Some complex cryptographic operations could use more detailed comments
   - Consider adding architecture diagrams to documentation

## Security Analysis

### Cryptographic Implementation (Excellent)
- **AES-256-GCM**: Industry-standard authenticated encryption
- **Proper Nonce Handling**: Unique nonces generated with `OsRng`
- **Key Generation**: Cryptographically secure random keys
- **Base64 Encoding**: Appropriate encoding schemes for different use cases

### Authentication (Good)
- **Bearer Token Authentication**: Simple and effective
- **Constant-Time Comparison**: Prevents timing attacks on token validation
- **Flexible Token Management**: Supports multiple tokens and no-auth mode

### Web Security (Good)
- **Security Headers**: Proper HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- **CORS Configuration**: Configurable allowed origins
- **Request Validation**: Proper UUID validation and TTL limits

## Testing Assessment

### Coverage (Excellent)
- **6 test files** with comprehensive test cases
- **Mock implementations** for all major components
- **Edge case testing** including error conditions
- **Integration testing** for end-to-end flows

### Test Quality
- Well-structured test cases with clear assertions
- Proper async test handling with tokio
- Good use of test utilities and builders

## Performance Considerations

### Strengths
- Efficient async/await implementation
- Proper connection pooling with Redis
- Minimal memory allocations in hot paths
- Configurable timeouts and limits

### Recommendations
- Consider implementing request rate limiting
- Add performance benchmarks for crypto operations
- Monitor memory usage with large file uploads

## Dependency Analysis

### Well-Chosen Dependencies
- **actix-web**: Mature, performant web framework
- **aes-gcm**: Well-maintained cryptographic library
- **tokio**: Standard async runtime
- **redis**: Reliable Redis client
- **thiserror**: Excellent error handling

### Recommendations
- Consider updating to latest versions where possible
- Add dependabot configuration for automated updates
- Evaluate need for some optional dependencies

## Recommended Improvements (Prioritized)

### Critical (Address Immediately)
1. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Add request rate limiting to prevent abuse
2. **Add Request Size Validation**: Validate request sizes at application level
3. **Improve Key Encoding**: Use full entropy for encryption keys

### High Priority (Next Sprint)
4. **Add Error Correlation IDs**: Improve debugging without information leakage
5. **Implement Metrics**: Add comprehensive metrics for monitoring
6. **Security Audit**: Conduct formal security review of cryptographic implementation

### Medium Priority (Next Month)
7. **Performance Benchmarks**: Add benchmarks for crypto operations
8. **Integration Tests**: Add end-to-end tests with real Redis
9. **Documentation**: Add architecture diagrams and security documentation

### Low Priority (Future)
10. **Code Organization**: Extract common utilities and improve modularity
11. **Dependency Updates**: Regular dependency maintenance
12. **Logging Enhancement**: Structured logging with better context

## Conclusion

Hakanai demonstrates excellent Rust engineering practices with a solid foundation in cryptography and web security. The codebase is well-tested, properly documented, and follows modern Rust idioms. The main areas for improvement are around operational concerns (rate limiting, monitoring) and some minor security enhancements.

The project is production-ready with the critical improvements addressed, particularly around resource management and rate limiting. The cryptographic implementation is sound and follows best practices for zero-knowledge secret sharing.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with deployment after addressing the critical issues, particularly rate limiting and request validation.
