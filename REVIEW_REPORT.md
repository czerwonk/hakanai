pub fn is_request_from_asn(req: &HttpRequest, app_data: &AppData, asns: &[u32]) -> bool {
    if let Some(name) = &app_data.asn_header
        && let Some(header_value) = extract_header_value(req, name)
        && let Ok(asn) = header_value.parse::<u32>()
    {
        return asns.contains(&asn);
    }
    false
}
```

**Minor Areas for Improvement:**
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end tests with real Redis backend
- **CLI Test Coverage**: Additional unit tests for CLI modules
- **Documentation**: Enhanced rustdoc for internal functions

### TypeScript/JavaScript Implementation: A- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Outstanding Strengths:**

- **Security-First**: Secure memory management with multi-pass data clearing
- **Performance**: Chunked processing (8KB chunks) for large file handling
- **Browser Compatibility**: Comprehensive feature detection with graceful degradation

**ASN Validation Implementation:**
- **Comprehensive Client Validation**: Complete ASN number validation (1-4294967295 range)
- **Type-Safe Error Handling**: Structured error codes for internationalization
- **UI Integration**: Clean restriction tabs with proper input parsing

```typescript
// Example of excellent ASN validation
static validateASN(asn: number): void {
    if (typeof asn !== "number" || !Number.isInteger(asn)) {
        throw new HakanaiError(HakanaiErrorCodes.INVALID_RESTRICTIONS, "ASN must be an integer");
    }
    if (asn === 0) {
        throw new HakanaiError(HakanaiErrorCodes.INVALID_RESTRICTIONS, "ASN 0 is reserved and cannot be used");
    }
    if (asn < 1 || asn > 4294967295) {
        throw new HakanaiError(HakanaiErrorCodes.INVALID_RESTRICTIONS, `Invalid ASN: ${asn}. Must be between 1 and 4294967295`);
    }
}
```

**Code Organization Excellence:**

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_crypto_client_roundtrip() {
    let mock_client = MockClient::new();
    let crypto_client = CryptoClient::new(mock_client);
    
    let original = Payload::from_text("test secret");
    let url = crypto_client.send(original.clone(), 3600, None).await.unwrap();
