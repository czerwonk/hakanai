- **Utility module architecture**: Extensible `utils/` structure for cross-cutting concerns
- **Content analysis**: Binary detection prevents data corruption automatically
- **Enhanced memory safety**: Comprehensive `CryptoContext` encapsulation with automatic cleanup

**Code Examples:**
```rust
// Simplified client architecture with enhanced security
pub fn new() -> impl Client<Payload> {
    CryptoClient::new(Box::new(WebClient::new()))
}

// CryptoContext with comprehensive memory safety
struct CryptoContext {
    key: Vec<u8>,
    nonce: Vec<u8>,
}

impl Drop for CryptoContext {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        self.zeroize();
    }
}

// Build-time template generation
fn generate_static_html_files() {
    let mut tt = TinyTemplate::new();
    let context = create_version_context();
