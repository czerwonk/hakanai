### Areas for Improvement

#### Minor Issues
1. **Build Configuration:**
   - Root `Cargo.toml` uses resolver "2" instead of "3" for edition 2024
   - Cargo database readonly warnings during builds

2. **Environment Handling:**
   - Test initially failed due to environment variable contamination
   - Consider test isolation improvements

3. **Missing Features:**
   - No integration tests between components
   - Missing performance benchmarks
   - Limited browser automation testing

#### Recommendations
1. **Upgrade resolver to "3"** in root Cargo.toml
2. **Add workspace-level dependency management**
3. **Implement integration test suite**
4. **Add performance benchmarks for crypto operations**
5. **Consider browser automation tests for web interface**
