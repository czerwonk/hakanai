## Remediation Priorities

### Critical Priority (Immediate Action Required)
All critical priority issues have been resolved.

### High Priority (Short-term Action)
None - all high priority issues have been resolved or accepted as documented trade-offs.

### Medium Priority (Medium-term Action)
None - all medium priority issues have been resolved or reclassified as false positives.

### Low Priority (Long-term Action)
None - all low priority issues have been resolved or reclassified as false positives.

## Documented Security Trade-offs

### WASM Content Security Policy Relaxation
**Context:** The QR code generation feature uses WebAssembly, which requires the `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` CSP directive.

**Technical Details:**
- CSP includes `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` to allow `WebAssembly.instantiate()` and `WebAssembly.compile()`
- Current browser implementations don't support hash-based CSP for WASM modules
- The WASM module is built from trusted source code at compile time
- The module is embedded in the server binary and served from the same origin

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Low Risk**: WASM module is compiled from trusted qrcode crate
- **Controlled Environment**: Module is built during server compilation, not loaded dynamically
- **Limited Scope**: Only used for QR code generation, a non-critical convenience feature
- **No User Input**: WASM module doesn't process untrusted user input directly

**Mitigation Measures:**
- WASM module is built from pinned, audited dependencies
- Module is embedded at compile time, preventing runtime tampering
- Regular dependency updates ensure security patches are applied
- QR code generation is an optional feature that can be disabled if needed

**Accepted Risk:** This CSP relaxation is accepted as a necessary trade-off for QR code functionality. The risk is minimal given the controlled build process and limited scope of the feature.

## Implementation Recommendations

### Current Security Implementation (Implemented)

The following security improvements have been successfully implemented:

**Memory Safety:**
- `CryptoContext` with comprehensive zeroization
- `Payload` struct with `Drop` + `Zeroize` implementation
- All sensitive data wrapped in `Zeroizing<T>` containers

- Proper authentication token handling
- Secure error handling without information disclosure
- Comprehensive test coverage (120+ tests)

## Conclusion

Hakanai demonstrates strong security with a comprehensive zero-knowledge architecture and robust cryptographic implementation. While the core security model remains excellent, the recent WASM QR code integration introduces some operational security considerations that should be addressed for production deployment.

**Key Strengths:**
- Zero-knowledge architecture with AES-256-GCM encryption
- Comprehensive memory safety with automatic zeroization
- Rust memory safety and comprehensive type system
- Proper use of cryptographic libraries and secure random generation
- Comprehensive test coverage including security edge cases (120+ tests)
- Type-safe client architecture preventing plaintext leakage
- Secure TypeScript client with proper memory clearing

**Resolved Critical Issues:**
- **Memory Safety**: Complete zeroization of all sensitive data implemented
- **Authentication**: Proper token validation and secure error handling
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation and sanitization
- **Web Interface**: Secure DOM handling and XSS protection
- **Architecture**: Simplified, secure client layer design

**Remaining Security Items:**
- **0 High-priority items**: All resolved or accepted as documented trade-offs
- **0 Medium-priority items**: All resolved or reclassified as false positives
- **0 Outstanding items**: All security issues resolved or properly classified

**Production Readiness:**
Hakanai now achieves an **A security rating** and is excellent for production deployment with proper infrastructure security (reverse proxy, TLS, monitoring). All security issues have been comprehensively addressed with only one documented trade-off (WASM CSP) remaining.

## Recommendations Summary
