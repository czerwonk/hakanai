## HIGH SEVERITY VULNERABILITIES

### 1. Authentication Token Storage in Plain Text
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Location:** `server/src/web_api.rs:111`  
**CWE:** CWE-256 (Unprotected Storage of Credentials)

**Issue:**
```rust
let tokens_map: HashMap<String, String> = tokens
    .clone()
    .into_iter()
    .map(|t| (hash_string(&t), t.to_string()))  // Original token stored!
    .collect();
```

Tokens are hashed but the original tokens are stored alongside their hashes in the AppData struct, creating unnecessary exposure in memory.

**Impact:** If memory is compromised through debugging, crash dumps, or memory attacks, plaintext tokens are exposed.

**Fix:**
```rust
let tokens_map: HashMap<String, ()> = tokens
    .clone()
    .into_iter()
    .map(|t| (hash_string(&t), ()))  // Only store hash
    .collect();
```

**Priority:** IMMEDIATE

---

### 2. Missing Input Size Validation in Cryptographic Operations
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Location:** `lib/src/crypto.rs:86-115`  
**CWE:** CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits)

**Issue:**
The decrypt function doesn't validate the size of encrypted data before processing, potentially allowing resource exhaustion attacks.

**Impact:** Large payloads could cause memory exhaustion, DoS, or system instability.

**Fix:**
```rust
pub fn decrypt(encrypted_data: &str, key: &[u8]) -> Result<String, CryptoError> {
    const MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE: usize = 50 * 1024 * 1024; // 50MB limit
    
    if encrypted_data.len() > MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE {
        return Err(CryptoError::PayloadTooLarge);
    }
    
    // ... rest of function
}
```

**Priority:** IMMEDIATE

---

### 3. Client-Side File Type Restrictions Easily Bypassed
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Location:** `server/src/includes/create-secret.js:94-99`  
**CWE:** CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type)

**Issue:**
File validation is only client-side and can be bypassed by attackers with basic technical knowledge.

**Impact:** Malicious files can be uploaded by bypassing client-side checks, potentially leading to stored XSS or other attacks.

**Fix:**
1. Implement server-side file type validation
2. Add content-type sniffing protection
3. Scan file contents for malicious patterns

**Priority:** IMMEDIATE

---

## MEDIUM SEVERITY VULNERABILITIES

### 4. Weak Content Security Policy
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** `server/src/includes/get-secret.html:12-14`  
**CWE:** CWE-1021 (Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers)

**Issue:**
CSP allows `upgrade-insecure-requests` but doesn't enforce `https-only` in strict contexts.

**Impact:** Mixed content attacks in certain deployment scenarios.

**Fix:**
```html
content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self'; font-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; block-all-mixed-content; upgrade-insecure-requests"
```

**Priority:** SHORT TERM

---

### 5. Path Traversal in File Download
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** `cli/src/get.rs:41-62`  
**CWE:** CWE-22 (Path Traversal)

**Issue:**
File path construction doesn't adequately validate against path traversal attacks.

**Impact:** Potential file system traversal when downloading files.

**Fix:**
```rust
// Sanitize filename to prevent path traversal
let sanitized_filename = filename
    .chars()
    .filter(|c| c.is_alphanumeric() || *c == '.' || *c == '_' || *c == '-')
    .collect::<String>();
    
let mut path = PathBuf::from("./downloads");
path.push(sanitized_filename);
```

**Priority:** SHORT TERM

---

### 6. Timing Attack Vulnerability in Token Validation
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** `server/src/web_api.rs:111-116`  
**CWE:** CWE-208 (Observable Timing Discrepancy)

**Issue:**
Token comparison using `contains_key` may be vulnerable to timing attacks.

**Impact:** Possible timing-based token enumeration.

**Fix:**
```rust
use subtle::ConstantTimeEq;

// Use constant-time comparison
let token_hash = hash_string(token);
let mut found = false;
for stored_hash in tokens.keys() {
    if token_hash.as_bytes().ct_eq(stored_hash.as_bytes()).into() {
        found = true;
        break;
    }
}
```

**Priority:** SHORT TERM

---

### 7. Information Disclosure in Error Messages
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** `lib/src/web.rs:50-56`  
**CWE:** CWE-209 (Information Exposure Through Error Messages)

**Issue:**
Error responses include detailed server information that could aid attackers.

**Impact:** Potential information leakage about server internals.

**Fix:**
```rust
// Sanitize error messages
let sanitized_error = match resp.status() {
    StatusCode::NOT_FOUND => "Resource not found".to_string(),
    StatusCode::UNAUTHORIZED => "Authentication required".to_string(),
    StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR => "Server error".to_string(),
    _ => "Request failed".to_string(),
};
```

**Priority:** SHORT TERM

---

## LOW SEVERITY VULNERABILITIES

### 8. Missing Rate Limiting
**Risk Level:** LOW  
**Location:** Throughout server endpoints  
**CWE:** CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits)

**Issue:** No rate limiting implemented for secret creation/retrieval.

**Impact:** Potential DoS through rapid requests.

**Fix:** Implement rate limiting middleware using actix-web-rate-limit or similar.

**Priority:** FUTURE

---

### 9. Predictable File Naming
**Risk Level:** LOW  
**Location:** `cli/src/get.rs:48-50`  
**CWE:** CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values)

**Issue:** Timestamp-based file naming is predictable.

**Impact:** Predictable file names could aid in attacks.

**Fix:**
```rust
use rand::Rng;
let random_suffix: String = rand::thread_rng()
    .sample_iter(&Alphanumeric)
    .take(8)
    .map(char::from)
    .collect();
let filename = format!("{}.{}", base_filename, random_suffix);
```

**Priority:** FUTURE

---

### 10. JavaScript Prototype Pollution Risk
**Risk Level:** LOW  
**Location:** `server/src/includes/hakanai-client.js:207-208`  
**CWE:** CWE-1321 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype)

**Issue:** JSON parsing without validation could allow prototype pollution.

**Impact:** Potential prototype pollution if malicious JSON is crafted.

**Fix:**
```javascript
const payloadJson = await this.decrypt(encryptedData, key);
const parsed = JSON.parse(payloadJson);
// Validate structure
if (typeof parsed !== 'object' || parsed === null) {
    throw new Error('Invalid payload structure');
}
return parsed;
```

**Priority:** FUTURE

---

### 11. Missing CSRF Protection
**Risk Level:** LOW  
**Location:** Server endpoints  
**CWE:** CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

**Issue:** No CSRF tokens implemented for state-changing operations.

**Impact:** Cross-site request forgery attacks possible.

**Fix:** Implement CSRF protection for POST endpoints.

**Priority:** FUTURE

---

## CRYPTOGRAPHIC SECURITY ANALYSIS

### ‚úÖ Strengths
- **AES-256-GCM:** Proper use of authenticated encryption
- **Secure Random Generation:** Uses `OsRng` for nonce generation
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture:** Client-side encryption ensures server never sees plaintext
- **Key Management:** Proper key derivation and URL fragment storage
- **Base64 Encoding:** Correctly differentiated between standard and URL-safe variants

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement
- **Key Stretching:** Consider PBKDF2/scrypt for user-provided passwords
- **Forward Secrecy:** No mechanism for key rotation
- **Nonce Reuse Protection:** Could be strengthened with additional checks

---

**Immediate actions needed:**
1. Fix token storage mechanism
2. Implement server-side validation
3. Add resource limits

**Overall Assessment:** With the recommended fixes, Hakanai can achieve a strong security posture suitable for production deployment. The core cryptographic design is sound, making this a solid foundation for a secure secret sharing service.

**Next Steps:**
1. Address high severity vulnerabilities immediately
2. Implement security testing pipeline
3. Regular security reviews and updates
4. Consider third-party security audit for production deployment
