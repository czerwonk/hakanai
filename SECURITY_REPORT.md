## Security Findings

### CRITICAL SEVERITY

No critical severity vulnerabilities remain after analysis and resolution of previously reported issues.

### HIGH SEVERITY

No high severity vulnerabilities remain after analysis and resolution of previously reported issues.

### MEDIUM SEVERITY

No medium severity vulnerabilities remain after analysis and resolution of previously reported issues.

### LOW SEVERITY

#### L1: Missing Token Rotation
**File:** `server/src/token.rs:16`  
**Description:** No token rotation mechanism for long-lived tokens

**Impact:** Long-lived tokens increase compromise risk over time.

**Recommendation:** Implement token rotation support for production deployments.

#### L2: Build System TypeScript Compiler Security
**File:** `server/build.rs:60-77`  
**Description:** TypeScript compiler executed without version validation

**Impact:** Supply chain attack risk if compiler is compromised.

**Recommendation:** Add version validation for TypeScript compiler during build process.

## Version 2.0 Security Improvements

### Token API System Security (NEW)
**Version 2.0** introduces a comprehensive Redis-based token management system with significant security enhancements:

**Security Strengths:**

- **Dual Token System**: Separate admin and user token namespaces with different privileges
- **Anonymous Access Control**: Configurable anonymous access with separate size limits
- **Token Validation**: Comprehensive validation with proper error handling
- **Secure Token Generation**: 32-byte cryptographically secure tokens using `OsRng`
- **URL-Safe Encoding**: Tokens encoded with Base64 URL-safe format
- **Admin API Security**: Admin endpoints properly protected with token validation
- **Token Metadata**: Support for per-token upload size limits

**Architecture Security:**
- **Trait-based Design**: Clean separation with `TokenStore`, `TokenValidator`, and `TokenCreator` traits
- **Memory Safety**: Token generation using `Zeroizing` containers
- **Error Handling**: Proper error types without information disclosure
- **Concurrent Safety**: Thread-safe token operations with proper Redis connection management

**Breaking Changes Security Benefits:**
- **Removed Environment Variables**: Eliminated `HAKANAI_TOKENS` environment variable exposure
