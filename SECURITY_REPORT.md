## Version 2.7.0+ Security Analysis - Multi-file Support & TypeScript Bundling

### Multi-file ZIP Implementation Security Assessment: **Excellent**

The multi-file support introduced in v2.7.0 demonstrates strong security engineering:

#### **Implementation Strengths:**
1. **Memory Safety**: All file data wrapped in `Zeroizing<Vec<u8>>` containers
2. **Path Security**: Uses safe `Path::file_name()` operations preventing traversal attacks
3. **Resource Management**: No unbounded resource consumption - operates on user files only
4. **Secure Cleanup**: Automatic zeroization of all sensitive data via `Drop` trait
5. **Proper Error Handling**: Comprehensive error propagation without information leakage

#### **Security Features:**
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: `Path::file_name()` extracts only filename component
- **Memory Protection**: Complete zeroization of file data and ZIP archives
- **Resource Bounds**: Relies on OS-level protections (appropriate for CLI tool)
- **Secure Timestamping**: Uses secure timestamp generation for ZIP filenames

### TypeScript Bundling System Security: **Excellent**

The TypeScript bundling system implemented with Rollup is secure and well-designed:

#### **Build Process Security:**
1. **No Command Injection**: All commands use safe `Command::new().args()` pattern
2. **Fixed Arguments**: No user input incorporated into command construction
3. **Environment Validation**: Proper checks for tool availability
4. **Safe File Processing**: Cache buster replacement uses simple string operations

#### **Security Benefits:**
- **Deterministic Builds**: Consistent output from Rollup configuration
- **Dependency Isolation**: Each page bundle includes only required dependencies
- **Cache Busting**: Prevents stale code serving
- **Static Bundling**: All code bundled at build time, no dynamic loading

## Version 2.6.0 Security Analysis - Hash Validation Implementation

### Hash Validation Security Assessment: **Excellent**

The newly implemented hash validation system represents a significant security enhancement while preserving the zero-knowledge architecture:

#### **Implementation Strengths:**
1. **Cryptographically Sound**: Uses SHA-256 for payload integrity verification
2. **Zero-Knowledge Preserved**: Hash transmitted in URL fragment, never reaches server
3. **Tamper Detection**: Prevents bit-flipping attacks and payload modifications
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy URLs without hashes continue to work securely
5. **Memory Safety**: Proper zeroization of hash data during computation
6. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive hash format validation (64 hex characters)
7. **Error Handling**: Secure error codes (`HASH_MISMATCH`) without information leakage

#### **Security Architecture:**
```
Send: Payload → JSON → Bytes → SHA-256 → Encrypt → URL#{key}:{hash}
Receive: URL#{key}:{hash} → Decrypt → Verify Hash → Deserialize
```

The hash is computed on the **plaintext JSON payload before encryption**, enabling end-to-end integrity verification while maintaining zero-knowledge principles.

#### **Hash Validation Features:**
- **URL Format**: New `#key:hash` format with 64-character hexadecimal hash
- **Legacy Support**: URLs without hash (`#key` format) remain functional
- **Client-side Validation**: Hash verification occurs entirely in browser/CLI
- **Tamper Detection**: Automatic failure when content has been modified
- **Type Safety**: Optional `hash?` parameter properly handled in TypeScript

#### **Security Benefits:**
- **Content Integrity**: Prevents undetected tampering with secret payloads
- **Attack Prevention**: Stops bit-flipping and payload modification attacks
- **Zero Additional Server Risk**: Hash validation adds no server-side attack surface
- **Graceful Degradation**: Legacy URLs continue working without hash validation
- **Clear Error Handling**: Tamper attempts result in clear `HASH_MISMATCH` errors

## Security Findings

### CRITICAL SEVERITY

No critical severity vulnerabilities identified in v2.8.4 or existing codebase.

### HIGH SEVERITY

No high severity vulnerabilities identified in v2.8.4 or existing codebase.

### MEDIUM SEVERITY

No medium severity vulnerabilities identified in v2.8.4 or existing codebase.

### LOW SEVERITY

#### L1: Build Script Command Output Logging [INFORMATIONAL]
**File:** `server/build.rs:87-94`
**Issue:** Build script logs command output to cargo warnings, which may include environment information.
**Risk:** Low - Only affects development builds, not production
**Recommendation:** Consider filtering sensitive environment variables from logged output if present.

#### L2: CLI File System Access [DOCUMENTED DESIGN DECISION]
**File:** `cli/src/send.rs`
**Issue:** CLI allows reading any file the user has access to.
**Risk:** None - This is intentional design for professional CLI usage
**Note:** Consistent with other CLI tools (rsync, scp, curl) that provide full user file access.

## Remediation Priorities

### Critical Priority (Immediate Action Required)
All critical priority issues have been resolved or determined to be non-issues.

### High Priority (Short-term Action)
All high priority issues have been resolved or accepted as documented trade-offs.

### Medium Priority (Medium-term Action)
All medium priority issues have been resolved or reclassified as false positives.

### Low Priority (Long-term Action)
All low priority issues have been resolved or reclassified as false positives.

## Documented Security Trade-offs

### WASM Content Security Policy Relaxation
**Context:** The QR code generation feature uses WebAssembly, which requires the `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` CSP directive.

**Technical Details:**
- CSP includes `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` to allow `WebAssembly.instantiate()` and `WebAssembly.compile()`
- Current browser implementations don't support hash-based CSP for WASM modules
- The WASM module is built from trusted source code at compile time
- The module is embedded in the server binary and served from the same origin

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Low Risk**: WASM module is compiled from trusted qrcode crate
- **Controlled Environment**: Module is built during server compilation, not loaded dynamically
- **Limited Scope**: Only used for QR code generation, a non-critical convenience feature
- **No User Input**: WASM module doesn't process untrusted user input directly

**Mitigation Measures:**
- WASM module is built from pinned, audited dependencies
- Module is embedded at compile time, preventing runtime tampering
- Regular dependency updates ensure security patches are applied
- QR code generation is an optional feature that can be disabled if needed

**Accepted Risk:** This CSP relaxation is accepted as a necessary trade-off for QR code functionality. The risk is minimal given the controlled build process and limited scope of the feature.
