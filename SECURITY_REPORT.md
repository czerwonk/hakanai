## Security Findings

### CRITICAL SEVERITY

No critical severity vulnerabilities remain after analysis and resolution of previously reported issues.

### HIGH SEVERITY

No high severity vulnerabilities remain after analysis and resolution of previously reported issues.

### MEDIUM SEVERITY

No medium severity vulnerabilities remain after analysis and resolution of previously reported issues.

### LOW SEVERITY

#### L1: Missing Token Rotation
**File:** `server/src/options.rs:44-46`  
**Description:** No token rotation mechanism

**Impact:** Long-lived tokens increase compromise risk.

**Recommendation:** Implement token rotation support.
