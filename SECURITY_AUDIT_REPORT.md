# Hakanai Security Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-06-30
**Auditor:** Claude Code
**Version:** 0.3.1
**Scope:** Complete codebase security review

## Executive Summary

Hakanai is a minimalist one-time secret sharing service that implements zero-knowledge principles with client-side encryption. The overall security posture is **GOOD** with several strong security implementations and only minor areas for improvement.

### Key Findings
- ‚úÖ Strong cryptographic implementation using AES-256-GCM
- ‚úÖ Zero-knowledge architecture preserves confidentiality
- ‚úÖ Timing attack protection implemented
- ‚úÖ Proper authentication and authorization
- ‚úÖ Good security headers and CSP
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor areas for hardening identified

## Detailed Findings

### üü¢ Strong Points

#### 1. Cryptographic Security
**Location:** `lib/src/crypto.rs`
- **AES-256-GCM:** Industry-standard authenticated encryption
- **Secure key generation:** Uses `OsRng` for cryptographically secure randomness
- **Proper nonce handling:** Unique nonce per encryption operation
- **Client-side encryption:** Zero-knowledge architecture prevents server access to plaintext

#### 2. Authentication & Authorization
**Location:** `server/src/api.rs:91-112`
- **Constant-time comparison:** Uses `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` for token validation (line 106)
- **Bearer token support:** Standard HTTP authorization header
- **Configurable authentication:** Optional token requirements

#### 3. Input Validation & Security Headers
**Location:** `server/src/main.rs:64-72`
- **Security headers implemented:**
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Clickjacking protection
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - MIME sniffing protection
  - `Strict-Transport-Security` - HTTPS enforcement
- **Upload size limits:** Configurable payload size restrictions
- **UUID validation:** Proper format validation for secret IDs

#### 4. Error Handling
**Location:** `server/src/api.rs:48-52`
- **Information disclosure prevention:** Generic error messages for failures
- **Proper logging:** Internal errors logged without exposing details
- **HTTP status codes:** Appropriate response codes (401, 403, 404, 500)

### üü° Areas for Improvement

#### 1. JavaScript Client Security ‚úÖ
**Location:** `server/src/includes/hakanai-client.js` (detailed audit completed)
- **Assessment:** Excellent security implementation with proper WebCrypto API usage
- **Cryptography:** AES-256-GCM correctly implemented with secure random generation
- **Architecture:** Maintains zero-knowledge principles with client-side only operations
- **Minor Issue:** Base64 encoding could be more robust for very large secrets
- **Recommendation:** Add chunked base64 encoding and WebCrypto feature detection

#### 2. CORS Configuration ‚úÖ
**Location:** `server/src/main.rs:93-110`
- **Current:** Secure default using `Cors::default()` (same-origin only)
- **Security:** Only allows cross-origin requests when explicitly configured
- **Assessment:** Properly implements principle of least privilege

#### 3. Redis Security
**Location:** `server/src/data_store.rs`
- **Current:** Basic Redis connection with connection manager
- **Zero-Knowledge Context:** Redis only stores encrypted blobs, reducing security impact
- **Note:** TLS support available via Redis connection string if needed
- **Assessment:** Minor concern due to zero-knowledge architecture

#### 4. Rate Limiting
**Status:** Intentionally not implemented (proxy-layer responsibility)
- **Architecture Decision:** Rate limiting handled by reverse proxy as documented in README
- **Current Documentation:** README mentions reverse proxy deployment but could be more explicit about rate limiting
- **Recommendation:** Clarify rate limiting expectations in deployment documentation

### üî¥ Security Vulnerabilities

**None identified** - No critical security vulnerabilities were found during this audit.

## Architecture Security Assessment

### Zero-Knowledge Implementation ‚úÖ
- Encryption/decryption happens entirely client-side
- Server only stores encrypted blobs
- Cryptographic keys never transmitted to server
- Fragment-based key sharing prevents server access

### Data Flow Security ‚úÖ
1. **Secret Creation:**
   - Client generates AES-256 key
   - Encrypts data with AES-256-GCM
   - Sends encrypted blob to server
   - Receives URL with key in fragment

2. **Secret Retrieval:**
   - Client extracts key from URL fragment
   - Fetches encrypted data from server
   - Decrypts data client-side
   - Server permanently deletes encrypted data

### Network Security ‚úÖ
- HTTPS enforcement via HSTS header
- Secure User-Agent detection for CLI vs browser
- Proper timeout configuration (10 seconds)
- CORS controls for cross-origin requests

## Dependency Analysis

### Core Dependencies Security Status
- **aes-gcm 0.10.3:** ‚úÖ Current and secure
- **reqwest 0.12.20:** ‚úÖ Modern HTTP client
- **actix-web 4.11.0:** ‚úÖ Mature web framework
- **redis 0.32.2:** ‚úÖ Current Redis client
- **opentelemetry:** ‚úÖ Observability stack

**Note:** Cargo audit check failed due to lock file issues, but manual review of dependencies shows current versions.

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Monitoring:** Add security-relevant metrics and alerts

### Medium Priority
1. **JavaScript Improvements:** Add chunked base64 encoding and WebCrypto feature detection
2. **Content Security Policy:** Consider stricter CSP for web interface

### Low Priority
1. **Documentation:** Add security considerations to README
2. **Penetration Testing:** Consider external security testing
3. **Dependency Scanning:** Set up automated vulnerability scanning

## Compliance & Standards

### Cryptographic Standards ‚úÖ
- **FIPS 140-2 Level 1:** AES-256-GCM meets requirements
- **NIST SP 800-38D:** GCM mode implementation compliant
- **RFC 5116:** Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data

### Security Best Practices ‚úÖ
- **OWASP Guidelines:** Input validation, secure headers implemented
- **Defense in Depth:** Multiple security layers present
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Minimal data exposure

## Conclusion

Hakanai demonstrates excellent security design with proper implementation of cryptographic principles and zero-knowledge architecture. The codebase shows security awareness with timing attack protection, proper error handling, and secure defaults.

The primary recommendations focus on operational security (rate limiting, Redis security) rather than fundamental architectural issues, indicating a mature security approach.

**Overall Security Rating:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (5/5 stars)

**Rating Justification:** With the comprehensive JavaScript client audit completed, all major security components have been thoroughly reviewed and found to implement excellent security practices. The zero-knowledge architecture is properly maintained across both Rust and JavaScript implementations.
